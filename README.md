# Gif It To Me
Gif It To Me is a multiplayer, interactive board game that challenges players to write the funniest or most clever caption for a selection of animated gifs. Players take turns judging each round. The first player to make it to the tenth space is the winner. We came up with the idea for Gif It To Me during the time of the Covid-19 quarantine, as it allows people who are separated to connect with one another and play an exciting online game of judgement.

The landing page gives players the option to either start a game or join a game. If the player would like to create a game, they can input the name of a game that they would like to start and choose between three and six players. They may then press the 'start game' button, at which point they will be redirected to the gameboard page. The player who creates the game board is automatically designated as 'Player1.'

If a Player wishes to join a game that already exists, they simply input the the name of the game into the 'join' input box and press the 'join game' button, which will redirect them to a gameboard that has already been created. players will be assigned 'Player2' through 'Player6' depending on the order in which they join the game.
