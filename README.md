# Gif It To Me

Description: A multiplayer, interactive board game that challenges players to write the funniest or most clever caption for a selection of animated gifs. Players take turns judging each round. The first player to make it to the tenth space is the winner

Motivation: during this time of quarantine and isolation, Gif It To Me allows people who are separated to connect with one another and play a fun online game of judgement

User Story: as a user, I want to relax and play games online with my friends. Gif It To Me provides endless minutes of fun, challenging people to face off in a virtual battle arena of wit and hilarity

Technologies: Sequelize, Socket.io, Materialize, Node, Express, Giphy API

Challenges: quarantine (working remotely), getting Socket.io to function correctly, figuring out all of our routes, building a gameboard

Successes: getting Socket.io to function correctly, getting the gifs to populate the correct divs correctly, mastering the CSS

Future Development: Add optional themes for each game (cat gifs, truck gifs, food gifs, etc), create an ongoing scoreboard to keep between groups of friends/game rooms, incorporate social media (posting your high scores or favorite caption/gif combos)
